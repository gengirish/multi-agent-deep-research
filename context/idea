4. Multi-Agent AI Deep Researcher

What it demonstrates:
An AI-powered research assistant for multi-hop, multi-source investigations. The system spins up specialized agents that:
Contextual Retriever Agent – Pulls data from research papers, news articles, reports, and APIs.
Critical Analysis Agent – Summarizes findings, highlights contradictions, and validates sources.
Insight Generation Agent – Suggests hypotheses or trends using reasoning chains.
Report Builder Agent – Compiles all insights into a structured report
Any more agents you want to add

Why it's ideal:
Showcases agent collaboration, retrieval-augmented reasoning, and long-context synthesis.
You can use frameworks like LangChain/Langgraph, LlamaIndex, etc to build this.
