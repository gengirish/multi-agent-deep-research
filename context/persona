Additional Agents to Consider
Based on persona needs, these agents would enhance the system:

Source Credibility Agent – Evaluates reliability scores for each source based on publication history, author credentials, citation networks, and cross-referencing

Temporal Analysis Agent – Tracks how information and consensus evolve over time, identifies outdated claims, and highlights emerging trends

Bias Detection Agent – Identifies potential biases in sources, flags echo chambers, and ensures diverse perspectives are represented

Query Refinement Agent – Improves initial research questions through clarification prompts, generates sub-queries for comprehensive coverage, and adapts search strategy based on preliminary findings

Citation Network Agent – Maps relationships between sources, identifies seminal works and derivative research, and discovers related investigations through citation graphs

Data Extraction Agent – Pulls structured data from unstructured text (statistics, dates, claims), normalizes formats across sources, and enables quantitative meta-analysis

Visual Synthesis Agent – Generates concept maps showing relationships between findings, creates timeline visualizations of evolving narratives, and produces comparison matrices for competing hypotheses

Success Metrics for Each Persona
