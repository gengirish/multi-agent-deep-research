# Project Rules for Claude Code

## Quick Start
- Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md for complete project overview
- This is a multi-agent research system with React frontend + FastAPI backend
- Three input modes: Type, Speak, Picture (with OCR + AI Vision)

## Key Implementation Details
- Picture input uses hybrid OCR + GPT-4 Vision for text extraction
- Analysis findings display as grouped bullet points (not repeated headings)
- All result cards have 400px max height with vertical scrolling
- Backend runs on port 8000, frontend on port 5173
- Uses OpenRouter for all LLM access (OPEN_ROUTER_KEY in .env)

## Code Patterns to Follow
- TypeScript strict mode in frontend
- React functional components with hooks
- CSS modules for component styling
- FastAPI with Pydantic models for backend
- Multi-agent orchestration in backend/orchestration/

## Recent Features
1. Picture input with camera + OCR + GPT-4 Vision
2. Scrollable result cards (400px max)
3. Grouped analysis findings with bullets
4. Two-stage AI processing with progress indicators
